# Smoking-Related-Fatalities-Prediction
This project builds a hybrid machine learning and statistical model to predict smoking-related fatalities using public health data. It integrates a Poisson GLM for disease categories strongly linked to smoking (e.g., cancers, circulatory and respiratory diseases) and an XGBoost Regressor for all other diagnoses.
